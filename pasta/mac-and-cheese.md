### * Ingredient Notes

#### Cheese Selection

Be sure to select softer, more oily cheeses. Sharp or firm cheeses tend to congeal quickly or "break" after melting. If it works in a grilled cheese sandwich, it will probably work here, too. 

This is one area that you can be creative with this recipe, and trying out combinations of multiple cheeses is highly recommended. Some good cheeses to select from include (but are certainly not limited to):

- Gruyere
- American
- Mild cheddar
- Colby

Using very young or fresh cheeses such as many goat cheeses/chevres or mozzarella has not proven to produce good results.

_A personal favorite combination of the recipe author is 8 oz. American and 4 oz. gruyere, but have fun playing with these cheeses and proportions._

#### Milk

Lower fat milk or nut milks can be used in lesser amounts. This may take some experimentation in order to get proper consistency.

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 375°F
2. In a pot, boil water then cook pasta about halfway. Drain pasta and set aside.
3. Add cornstarch, salt, dry mustard, and black pepper to a medium-sized saucepan and stir in milk.
4. Bring liquid to a boil over medium heat. Add 3 tbsp. butter. Stir frequently.
5. Remove the saucepan from the heat and add in 10 oz. of cheese. Stir until cheese is melted.
6. Add the drained pasta into the mixture and stir to coat with cheese mixture.
7. In a small pan, melt remaining 1 tbsp. butter over medium-high heat.
8. When butter is done foaming, add in breadcrumbs and stir to coat. Continue frying breadcrumbs until lightly browned.
9. In a 2 qt. casserole dish, pour in pasta and cheese mixture and spread evenly.
10. Sprinkle remaining cheese evenly over top of pasta, followed by even sprinkling of fried breadcrumbs.
11. Bake (uncovered) for 30 minutes. Mac and cheese should be bubbling and breadcrumbs should be crispy and dark brown.
