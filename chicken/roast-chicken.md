# Roast Chicken

Chicken roasting is not particularly complicated, but there are many different small things that can be done that—when taken together—make a huge difference on the end result. This will attempt to consolidate and explain those things in detail so that each of them can be understood and that you can combine them to make a fantastic roast chicken!

I will note that none of these ideas are my own. First, it's hard to come up with unique ideas on something like roasting chicken. Second, I doubt that if one found a unique idea that it would be something they'd want to actually _do_ with something as classic as roast chicken. I say this so that I'm not credited with any of these things, because they've all been acquired from other (brilliant) people and consolidated into my cooking over time.

Since I have no idea how large your chicken is nor what other variables differ between your chickens and mine, you will have to play around with measurements over time. I promise you will start to get a "feel" for the right amounts of things when you have enough practice doing this. My hope is that I can outline the *why* of things in this article rather than simply giving you complete step-by-step instructions, which can be easily found online.

## Preparation

### Separate—don't remove—the skin

Sliding your finger in between the skin and the meat will allow you to detach the skin from the meat. The goal is not to remove the skin from the chicken but just to separate it. You will feel where the skin is attached at the center breastbone and can leave that attached so that the skin does not come completely off. Separating the skin leads to crispier skin because the skin has more air circulation around it. Later, when you season the chicken, the seasoning will also go in between the skin and the meat, and separating the skin makes this possible.

### Dry it well

One would normally think that this is the opposite of what's wanted; dry chicken is not what you want to put in your mouth, right? But the up-front drying leads to better, moister chicken in the end. I'm not sure if I ever knew _why_ exactly this is the case, but it most definitely is true. If I had to venture a guess, I would say that it likely has to do with the osmosis during the dry brining (that we will be doing next).

To dry the bird I usually run twine under the wings, tie the ends of the twine together, forming a loop, and hang it over my sink for about an hour to let it drain out. Over this period I hear a steady _drip, drip, drip_ of liquid hitting the sink bottom that slows down over time. Not knowing how your kitchen is laid out, you may have to improvise another way of hanging it.

### Salt it

When you see the amount of salt necessary for dry brining, it looks like a lot, but there is a good reason why it actually is not as much as it looks like. When you salt the surface of the meat for dry brining and let the meat sit in the refrigerator, there are stages of *osmosis* that are gone through that equalize the distribution of the salt throughout the meat.

When you salt something at the end of cooking it, you get salt on the surface, but without the time to be drawn into the meat it all stays on the surface. When you then bite it, all of the salt on the surface hits your tongue at once. In contrast, when you salt something in order to brine it, you also add _time_ to the equation.

Water and salt are attracted to each other. When you salt the surface of the meat, the salt will begin to at first draw moisture out of it and then over time the meat (which retains moisture) will begin drawing the sodium into it and the salt will be distributed evenly throughout the meat rather than being concentrated on the surface. Having dried the chicken already, I suspect—although I cannot prove—that the salt is drawn into the meat more quickly because there is less moisture for the salt to draw out. If anyone knows the answer, I would love to hear it.

I use kosher salt because it's easier to handle and see, and most chefs do as well, but you can do the same with table salt, albeit the amount will need to be less because the granules are smaller. I suggest you get acquainted with one type of salt very well and use it for everything. From a practical perspective, what you want to do is to rub the salt onto the meat underneath the skin that we've already detached. I usually pull the skin away a bit and sprinkle a good amount of salt in the pocket between the skin and the meat, then take my fingers and rub the salt somewhat evenly over the surface of the meat. Continue doing this until you've covered the surface of the meat on the entire chicken.

The last step is to wait. I usually do this overnight because—up to a point—the longer you let this do its "magic", the better the result will be. The absolute minimum I would say is two hours, but you'll get much better results from eight or more. Place the bird in the fridge and let time do its thing. I tend to leave the bird uncovered, but this is probably more for convenience than for any particular reason.

### Season it

After the dry brining is complete and we're getting ready to cook the chicken, we will likely have other seasonings (herbs and/or spices) that we want to apply, and this is a good time to apply them.

Skin is meant to act as a barrier. It keeps things in and keeps things out. It is for this reason that I do the same thing with the seasonings as I do with the salt, and apply them under the skin. This has the benefit of getting the meat nicely seasoned so that you don't pull off all of the seasoning along with the skin, but the skin usually gets a fair amount on the underside as well.

## Cooking

### Goal temperatures

A whole chicken does not have a single temperature at which it is done. Food safety guidelines often give you one for simplicity's sake, but cooking an entire chicken to this temperature (usually somewhere around 165F) results in a dry, overcooked chicken for the most part. White meat (breast and wings) are done at 145F, and dark meat is done at 160F. When roasting a chicken, it is important to note that the chicken will continue cooking itself from residual heat after you remove it from the oven. For this reason I usually pull the chicken from the oven when the dark meat is at 155F. Since you cannot cook the dark and white meat separately without parting out the chicken, I use different ways (outlined below) of ensuring that the white meat cooks more slowly.

### What not to do

The cooking methods listed below offer different ways of *doing* things, but just as important is what you *should not do*, no matter which method you are using.

Do not oil or otherwise lubricate the bird with any fat or anything wet. The skin has plenty of fat in it, and the bird has plenty of fat in various places; using oil or any water or wine or what-have-you will only serve to make the skin soggy. There is only one exception to this with the cast-iron method which I will outline below.

Do not try to go by sight or some sort of spidey sense when it comes to temperatures. This results in subpar results. Just get a thermometer and use it. Measure the inside of the thigh, insuring that the tip is in the meat and you are not touching bone when taking your readings.

Do not cut into the chicken right away after removing it from the oven. The chicken will continue to cook for a few minutes, and I am a firm believer in resting meat before cutting it open. We can argue about this if you'd like, just not here. :)

### The methods available

There are many methods available that claim to be the best, but I've found good results with a couple that have become my go-to methods.

The first of the two methods is more traditional, and leaves the bird whole. The chicken is trussed and cooked *breast-side down* and **on a rack** such that there is airflow around the entire bird. This allows for a very traditional, pretty presentation, but is also sometimes harder to perfect and can result in differences in doneness between the white meat and the dark.

The second of the two methods is more work but winds up being more predictable in my experience. The bird is spatchcocked and then the inside ("bottom") of the bird is cooked in a cast-iron skillet for a few minutes and then moved to the oven to finish. This precooks the dark meat on the stove (which should be cooked to a higher temperature) while allowing the chicken to bake with the entirety of the skin facing up in the oven, therefore making it very crispy.

### The traditional method

Cooking with the breast-side down allows the dark meat to cook closer to the element and therefore achieve higher temperatures, shielding the white meat from overcooking. I have mentioned above that the bird is cooked on a rack so that there is airflow around the bird during the entire cooking process. This is for the purposes of crispy skin. The bird is also trussed to prevent wingtips and legs from jutting out too far from the body and becoming overcooked.

If you have a leave-in thermometer, place it as mentioned above and place the bird in a preheated 350F oven on a rack which places the chicken right about in the middle. When the dark meat reaches 155F, pull the bird immediately from the oven and let it rest for at least 15 minutes before carving.

### The cast-iron method

This works very well to ensure nice doneness consistency even when the different parts require different internal temperatures in the end. The chicken is spatchcocked, which you can find many different videos for on YouTube or similar.

Heat a small amount of oil over medium-high heat in a cast-iron skillet big enough to fit the entire spatchcocked bird. In the meantime, preheat the oven to 400F. Once the oil is heated, place the bird with the meat facing up. This means that the thighs will be in contact with the pan, which is exactly what we want to give them a head start on cooking. How long you cook the chicken on the stove depends largely on the size of the chicken. This is the only real time I've been okay using some Jedi judgment on doneness because we'll continue baking it after. I would say around 10 minutes should suffice depending on the size of the bird. You do not want to fully cook the thighs, just give them a head start.

Once the chicken is finished on the stove, place the entire cast-iron pan in the preheated 400F oven for the rest of the cooking time, using a thermometer to pull the chicken when the breast is at 140F and the thigh is at 155F. Remove the entire pan and let it rest. The chicken will continue to cook for the remaining 5 degrees F on the counter.
